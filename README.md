IBM Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System
This project implements a Recommendation System using both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to recommend articles to users based on their previous interactions. The system uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and KMeans clustering for collaborative filtering, and cosine similarity for content-based recommendations.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Dependencies
Python 3.x

pandas: For data manipulation

numpy: For numerical operations

scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms such as SVD and KMeans clustering

cosine_similarity: For content-based recommendations

Installation
To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

Install Python on your machine from python.org.

Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/Nandan161/ibm-recommendation-system.git
Create a virtual environment and activate it:


python -m venv recommend_env
source recommend_env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
recommend_env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
Install the required dependencies:


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
How the Recommendation System Works
The system is built using both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques:

Content-Based Filtering
In content-based filtering, recommendations are made based on the similarity between articles that a user has previously interacted with and other articles in the dataset. The content similarity is computed using cosine similarity on the latent factor matrix (using SVD).

Function: get_svd_similar_article_ids(article_id, vt, user_item, include_similarity=False)

This function calculates the similarity between an article and all other articles using SVD.

It returns a list of the most similar article IDs to the specified article ID.

Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering utilizes user-item interaction data, clustering similar users together using KMeans or making predictions using SVD.

Function: get_svd_similar_article_ids(article_id, vt, user_item, include_similarity=False)

It returns a list of articles based on user interactions with similar articles.

Example of Generating Recommendations
You can generate article recommendations using the following method:

First, identify the article ID for which you want to generate recommendations.

Then, use SVD to find the most similar articles based on cosine similarity.

Example Steps:

Find the article index for the given article ID.

Compute the cosine similarity between the articleâ€™s latent vector and all other articles.

Sort the articles based on their similarity scores and return the top 10 most similar articles.

Project Instructions
The recommendation system involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Prepare a user-item interaction matrix where each row represents a user, each column represents an article, and the values indicate whether a user has interacted with an article (1 for interaction, 0 for no interaction).

Matrix Factorization (SVD):

Decompose the user-item interaction matrix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract latent factors representing user preferences and item characteristics.

Content-Based Filtering:

Use cosine similarity to recommend articles similar to a given article based on the latent factors from SVD.

Collaborative Filtering:

Use KMeans clustering to group similar users and recommend articles based on the interactions of users in the same cluster.

Alternatively, use SVD for collaborative filtering to predict missing interactions.

Testing
To ensure the recommendation system works as expected, test the following:

Content-based recommendations: Verify the similarity calculations by checking if recommended articles are relevant based on the article's content.

Collaborative filtering: Ensure that similar users are grouped together, and recommendations for a user from a similar group are sensible.

Break Down Tests
SVD-based similarity: Validate that the SVD transformation produces meaningful latent factors.

Cluster-based recommendations: Verify that articles recommended to users from the same cluster are relevant.
